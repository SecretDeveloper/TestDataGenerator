TestDataGenerator
=================

This is a very basic library which can be used to create data of varying types. 
The main purpose is to generate dummy data which can be used for testing.

You provide it with a pattern which you want to generate and it will create 
random data to match that pattern.

The pattern is as follows:
- * - An uppercase or lowercase letter or number.
- L - An uppercase Letter.
- l - A lowercase letter.
- V - An uppercase Vowel.
- v - A lowercase vowel.
- C - An uppercase Consonant.
- c - A lowercase consonant.
- X - Any number, 0-9.
- x - Any number, 1-9.
